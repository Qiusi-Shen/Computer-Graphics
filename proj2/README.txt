This is a shooting game.

We can control a player to shoot a bullet.
We can move the player by 
'left' 'right' 'up' 'down' 'i' 'k' 
on the keyborad.

Then press alt+a to shoot.

It has different scene using lookat function.

The polygon is a house. And I and two different texture on it.
And I put in the corresponding position, normals, and texture.

Finally I added a ballon for fun.

Enjoy the game!!!
